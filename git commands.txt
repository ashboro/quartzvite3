Clone & Make new


Absolutely — here's how to clone an existing GitHub repository, reinitialize it as a fresh local Git repo, and push it to a new GitHub repository.

🧭 Scenario: Clone → Clean → Reconnect to New GitHub Repo
1. Clone the original repo
git clone https://github.com/olduser/old-repo.git


2. Rename or move the folder (optional)
mv old-repo new-repo
cd new-repo


3. Remove the old Git history
rm -rf .git


4. Initialize a fresh Git repository
git init


5. Add all files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from cleaned clone"


6. Create a new GitHub repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repo (e.g., new-repo). Don’t initialize with README or .gitignore.








7. Connect your local repo to the new GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/youruser/new-repo.git


8. Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main



🧩 Optional Enhancements
- Add a .gitignore before committing if needed.
- Use gh repo create (GitHub CLI) for faster repo creation.
- If you're prepping this for LMS or plugin workflows, I can help structure the repo for Markdown, SCORM, or Excalidraw compatibility.

Caused by inclusion of YAML to make site


You're hitting a GitHub security restriction: your Personal Access Token (PAT) doesn't have the required workflow scope to push changes to GitHub Actions workflows (like .github/workflows/build-preview.yaml).

🔐 Why this happens
GitHub protects workflow files because they can trigger automated actions. To push changes to .github/workflows/*, your token must explicitly include the workflow scope.

✅ How to fix it
1. Create a new Personal Access Token with workflow scope
- Go to GitHub Developer Settings
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Select scopes:
- ✅ repo (full access to repositories)
- ✅ workflow (needed to push workflow files)
- Generate and copy the token
2. Update your Git credentials


f you're using HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin https://<your-token>@github.com/youruser/your-repo.git


Or use a credential manager:
git credential-manager-core erase
git credential-manager-core store


Then push again:
git push -u origin main








=======================================

…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# obswebexample" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ashboro/obswebexample.git
git push -u origin main

git status


…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/ashboro/obswebexample.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

🚀 Step-by-Step: Hosting a Vite Site on Hostinger
1. Build Your Vite Project
Run the following command in your project directory:
npm run build


This generates a production-ready version of your site in the dist folder.
2. Prepare for Upload
- Ensure your vite.config.js has the correct base path:
export default {
  base: './',
}


- This ensures relative paths work correctly on shared hosting.
3. Upload to Hostinger
- Log into your Hostinger control panel.
- Open the File Manager or use FTP.
- Navigate to the public_html directory.
