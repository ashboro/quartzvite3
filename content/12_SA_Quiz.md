# Short Answer Quiz

### 1. Carbon's ability to form four stable covalent bonds is highlighted as crucial for its role as the 'backbone' of macromolecules. If carbon could only form two covalent bonds, how would this fundamentally limit the complexity and diversity of biological molecules compared to what exists?

### 2. The document explains that single carbon-carbon bonds allow rotation, while double and triple bonds are rigid. Explain how this difference in rotational freedom could impact the biological function of a large macromolecule, using an example of a specific macromolecule type (e.g., protein, lipid) if you can infer one.

### 3. Hydrocarbons are presented as basic frameworks, but biological macromolecules like proteins and DNA have very specific and diverse functions. Beyond the carbon backbone, what additional feature, briefly mentioned in the learning objectives, would be necessary to confer such specific chemical properties and biological activity to these complex organic molecules?

<details>
<summary>Need a clue?</summary>

*Recall the second learning objective about describing the function of certain 'groups' that attach to organic molecules.*
