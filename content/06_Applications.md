# Real-World Applications

## Daily Life / Energy

Hydrocarbons, such as methane in natural gas and the components of gasoline, are primarily used as combustible fuel sources for electricity generation, heating homes, and powering transportation like cars and airplanes.

## Technology / Materials Science

Carbon's ability to form diverse covalent bonds leads to materials like diamond (extreme hardness for industrial cutting), graphite (softness and electrical conductivity for lubricants and battery electrodes), and advanced carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, used in high-strength composites for aircraft and space structures, as well as in electronics and sensors.

## Medicine / Pharmaceuticals

Aromatic hydrocarbons, characterized by their stable ring structures, are foundational for synthesizing many medications, including analgesics (like aspirin), anti-inflammatory drugs, and various pharmaceuticals used to treat serious illnesses. Phenol derivatives are also used as antiseptics and disinfectants.

## Daily Life / Food & Nutrition

Carbohydrates, which are organic compounds primarily made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, serve as the body's main energy source. Simple sugars provide quick energy, while complex carbohydrates like starch offer sustained energy release. Lipids, another carbon-based macromolecule, are crucial for energy storage, insulation, and forming cell membranes, and are found in foods like oils and seeds.

## Industrial Chemistry / Manufacturing

Hydrocarbons are vital raw materials in the petrochemical industry, serving as building blocks for producing plastics (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene), synthetic fibers (like nylon and polyester), rubber, solvents, and detergents.
