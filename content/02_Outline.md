# Document Outline

Here is a hierarchical outline of the document's main topics and sub-topics, structured for easy conversion into a mind map:

**Carbon's Role and Bonding in Biological Molecules**
*   **I. Introduction to Carbon's Essential Role**
    *   A. Organic Molecules Defined
        *   1. Substances containing carbon
        *   2. Vital for life
    *   B. Macromolecules
        *   1. Complex organic molecules
        *   2. Examples: proteins, nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), carbohydrates, lipids
    *   C. Carbon as the Foundational Building Block ("Backbone")

*   **II. Carbon Atom Structure and Bonding**
    *   A. Atomic Characteristics
        *   1. Atomic number: 6 (6 protons, 6 electrons)
        *   2. Electron distribution: 2 in inner shell, 4 in outer (valence) shell
    *   B. Covalent Bonding Capacity
        *   1. Octet Rule: atoms tend to form bonds to achieve 8 outer shell electrons
        *   2. Carbon forms up to 4 covalent bonds
        *   3. Forms strong bonds
    *   C. Example: Methane (CH4)
        *   1. Central carbon bonded to 4 hydrogen atoms
        *   2. Fills carbon's outer shell
        *   3. Tetrahedral geometry (109.5° bond angles)

*   **III. Hydrocarbons: Basic Organic Structures**
    *   A. Definition
        *   1. Organic molecules made entirely of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H)
        *   2. Example: Methane (CH4)
    *   B. Energy Storage
        *   1. Numerous covalent bonds store large amounts of energy
        *   2. Energy released when oxidized (e.g., burning as fuel)
    *   C. Three-Dimensional Shape (Conformation)
        *   1. Crucial for how large molecules (macromolecules) function
        *   2. Influenced by bond types and electron orbitals

*   **IV. Hydrocarbon Chains and Geometries**
    *   A. Chain Structures
        *   1. Can be straight, branched, or combinations
        *   2. Form the main structure of large biological molecules
    *   B. Types of Carbon-Carbon Covalent Bonds
        *   1. **Single Bonds** (e.g., Ethane)
            *   a. Suffix: "-ane"
            *   b. Geometry: Tetrahedral around each carbon
            *   c. Flexibility: Allows rotation around the bond axis
        *   2. **Double Bonds** (e.g., Ethene)
            *   a. Suffix: "-ene"
            *   b. Geometry: Planar (flat) arrangement
            *   c. Flexibility: Cannot rotate, atoms locked in place
        *   3. **Triple Bonds** (e.g., Ethyne)
            *   a. Suffix: "-yne"
            *   b. Geometry: Linear (straight) arrangement
            *   c. Flexibility: Highly restricted rotation

*   **V. Hydrocarbon Rings: Aliphatic and Aromatic**
    *   A. Ring Structures
        *   1. Carbon atoms form closed rings
        *   2. Can be five- or six-membered rings (or more)
    *   B. Aliphatic Hydrocarbons
        *   1. Characterized by linear chains OR rings with *only single bonds* between carbons
        *   2. Example: Cyclopentane, Cyclohexane
    *   C. Aromatic Hydrocarbons
        *   1. Consist of closed rings of carbon atoms
        *   2. Feature *alternating single and double bonds* (creating resonance)
        *   3. Example: Benzene ring
        *   4. Biological Relevance: found in amino acids, cholesterol, hormones (estrogen, testosterone)
        *   5. Real-world examples: herbicide 2,4-D
        *   6. Health Implications: Benzene is a carcinogen
    *   D. Mixed Structures: Some hydrocarbons contain both aliphatic and aromatic parts (e.g., Beta-carotene)
