### 2. To satisfy the octet rule, a carbon atom typically forms up to four covalent bonds with other atoms.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

<details>
<summary>View Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer:** False

*Explanation: The document defines hydrocarbons as 'organic molecules made entirely of carbon and hydrogen,' not carbon and oxygen.*

### 4. Carbon-carbon single bonds allow for free rotation around the bond's axis, while double bonds result in a planar arrangement and cannot rotate.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

<details>
<summary>View Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer:** True

*Explanation: The document states, 'Single bonds, like those in ethane, are able to rotate. Double bonds, like those in ethene, cannot rotate, so the atoms on either side are locked in place,' and also describes double bonds leading to a 'planar, or flat' shape.*

</details>

### 5. Aromatic hydrocarbons consist of closed rings of carbon atoms that have only single bonds.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

<details>
<summary>View Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer:** False

*Explanation: The document defines aromatic hydrocarbons as consisting of 'closed rings of carbon atoms that have alternating single and double bonds,' in contrast to aliphatic hydrocarbons which have only single bonds in their rings.*
