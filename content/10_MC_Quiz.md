# Multiple Choice Quiz

### 1. What is the atomic number of carbon, and how are its electrons distributed in its shells according to the document?

- [ ] Atomic number 6; four electrons in the inner shell and two in the outer shell.
- [ ] Atomic number 6; two electrons in the inner shell and four in the outer shell.
- [ ] Atomic number 12; six electrons in the inner shell and six in the outer shell.
- [ ] Atomic number 4; two electrons in the inner shell and two in the outer shell.

**Correct Answer:** Atomic number 6; two electrons in the inner shell and four in the outer shell.

*Explanation: The document states that carbon has an atomic number of 6, meaning six electrons, with the first two electrons occupying the inner shell and four electrons remaining in the second (outermost) shell.*

### 2. According to the text, what is a primary characteristic of hydrocarbons regarding energy?

- [ ] They are known for absorbing energy, making them excellent coolants.
- [ ] The numerous covalent bonds between atoms store a large amount of energy, which is released upon oxidation.
- [ ] They primarily store energy in their ionic bonds, which are easily broken.
- [ ] They are used in artist materials because they require very little energy to synthesize.

**Correct Answer:** The numerous covalent bonds between atoms store a large amount of energy, which is released upon oxidation.

*Explanation: The document explicitly states, 'The numerous covalent bonds between atoms in hydrocarbons store a large amount of energy, which is released when these molecules burn (oxidize).'*

### 3. Which of the following correctly describes the geometry and rotational freedom associated with a carbon-carbon double bond?

- [ ] Tetrahedral shape with free rotation.
- [ ] Planar shape with restricted rotation.
- [ ] Linear shape with free rotation.
- [ ] Bent shape with no rotation.

<details>
<summary>View Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer:** Planar shape with restricted rotation.

*Explanation: The document explains that double bonds result in a 'flat (planar) arrangement' and 'cannot rotate, so the atoms on either side are locked in place.'*

### 4. How does an aliphatic hydrocarbon ring primarily differ from an aromatic hydrocarbon ring, based on the provided text?

- [ ] Aliphatic rings contain nitrogen, while aromatic rings do not.
- [ ] Aliphatic rings have only single bonds between carbons, while aromatic rings have alternating single and double bonds.
- [ ] Aliphatic rings are always linear, while aromatic rings are are always closed loops.
- [ ] Aliphatic rings are found in crude oil, while aromatic rings are only synthetic.

<details>

**Correct Answer:** Aliphatic rings have only single bonds between carbons, while aromatic rings have alternating single and double bonds.

*Explanation: The document defines aliphatic hydrocarbons as having 'only single bonds' within their rings, while aromatic hydrocarbons consist of 'closed rings of carbon atoms that have alternating single and double bonds.'*

### 5. What is emphasized as crucial for the function of large biological molecules (macromolecules) that use hydrocarbons as their main structure?

- [ ] Their ability to dissolve in water.
- [ ] Their constant state of rotation due to single bonds.
- [ ] Their three-dimensional shape, or conformation.
- [ ] Their lack of hydrogen atoms.

<details>
<summary>View Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer:** Their three-dimensional shape, or conformation.

*Explanation: The document explicitly states, 'This three-dimensional shape, or conformation, of these large molecules (macromolecules) is crucial to how they function.'*
