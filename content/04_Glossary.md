# Glossary of Key Terms

## Macromolecules
Complex molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids (like RNA and DNA), carbohydrates, and lipids, which are vital components of cells.

---

## Organic molecule
Any substance, whether liquid, solid, or gas, that contains carbon, and is especially vital for life.

---

## Carbon
The foundational element that serves as the main structural component, or 'backbone,' for all biological macromolecules.

---

## Carbon atom structure
An atom with an atomic number of 6, possessing two electrons in its inner shell and four valence electrons in its second (outermost) shell.

---

## Octet rule
The principle stating that atoms tend to form bonds so they have eight electrons in their outermost electron shell to achieve stability.

---

## Covalent bonds
Chemical bonds formed by the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, which carbon atoms can form up to four of.

---

## Methane (CH4)
The simplest hydrocarbon molecule, featuring a central carbon atom bonded by single covalent bonds to four different hydrogen atoms, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry.

---

## Tetrahedral geometry
A three-dimensional molecular shape where a central carbon atom forms four single bonds, positioning the bonded atoms at the vertices of a tetrahedron with approximately 109.5° angles.

---

## Hydrocarbons
Organic molecules made entirely of carbon and hydrogen, capable of storing large amounts of energy in their covalent bonds.

---

## Hydrocarbon chains
A series of bonds between carbon atoms that can be straight, branched, or unbranched, forming the main structure of large molecules.

---

## Single covalent bond
A carbon-carbon bond formed by sharing one pair of electrons, allowing rotation around its axis and leading to tetrahedral geometry around the carbon.

---

## Double covalent bond
A carbon-carbon bond formed by sharing two pairs of electrons, resulting in a flat (planar) molecular arrangement and restricting rotation around the bond.

---

## Triple covalent bond
A carbon-carbon bond formed by sharing three pairs of electrons, leading to a straight (linear) molecular arrangement and highly restricted rotation.

---

## Planar arrangement
A molecular geometry where atoms, particularly those involved in a double bond, lie in a single flat plane.

---

## Linear arrangement
A molecular geometry where atoms, particularly those involved in a triple bond, are arranged in a straight line.

---

## Aliphatic hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons characterized by linear chains of carbon atoms or rings where all carbon-carbon bonds within the ring are single bonds.

---

## Aromatic hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons consisting of closed rings of carbon atoms that have alternating single and double bonds, such as the benzene ring.

---

## Benzene ring
A specific type of aromatic hydrocarbon, typically a six-membered carbon ring with alternating single and double bonds, found in various biological molecules and identified as a carcinogen.

---

## Carcinogen
A substance that has the potential to cause cancer.

---

## Conformation
The specific three-dimensional shape or spatial arrangement of a molecule, which is crucial to how large molecules (macromolecules) function.
