# Key Terms & Concepts

- Carbon's Role in Biological Molecules
  - Organic Molecule
    - Definition: Substance containing carbon
    - Vital for life
  - Macromolecules
    - Proteins
    - Nucleic acids
      - RNA
      - DNA
    - Carbohydrates
    - Lipids
  - Foundational building block
- Carbon Atom Structure
  - Atomic number: 6
  - Electron distribution
    - 2 inner shell
    - 4 outer shell (valence)
  - Octet Rule
    - Achieve 8 electrons in outermost shell
  - Covalent bonds
    - Forms up to four
    - Forms strong bonds
  - Flexibility (main structural component)
  - Methane (CH4) example
    - Carbon bonded to 4 hydrogen atoms
    - Tetrahedral geometry
- Hydrocarbons
  - Definition: Made entirely of carbon and hydrogen
  - Energy storage
    - Numerous covalent bonds
    - Released when molecules burn (oxidize)
  - Molecular shape (conformation)
    - Crucial to how they function
- Hydrocarbon Chains: Types and Geometries
  - Chain structures
    - Straight chains
    - Branched chains
    - Unbranched chains
    - Combinations (of chains and rings)
  - Carbon-carbon bond types
    - Single covalent bonds
      - Suffix: -ane
      - Geometry: Tetrahedral
      - Characteristic: Allows rotation around bond axis
      - Example: Ethane
    - Double covalent bonds
      - Suffix: -ene
      - Geometry: Planar (flat)
      - Characteristic: Cannot rotate
      - Example: Ethene
    - Triple covalent bonds
      - Suffix: -yne
      - Geometry: Linear (straight)
      - Characteristic: Highly restricted rotation
      - Example: Ethyne
  - Nomenclature
    - Prefixes (e.g., eth- for two carbons)
    - Suffixes (-ane, -ene, -yne for bond type)
- Hydrocarbon Rings: Aliphatic and Aromatic
  - Aliphatic hydrocarbons
    - Characteristics: Linear chains OR rings with only single bonds
    - Ring examples: Cyclopentane, Cyclohexane
  - Aromatic hydrocarbons
    - Characteristics: Closed rings with alternating single and double bonds
    - Benzene ring example
      - Incorporated into biological molecules
      - Biological examples: amino acids, cholesterol, hormones (estrogen, testosterone)
      - Other examples: herbicide 2,4-D
      - Health risk: Carcinogen
  - Mixed structures
    - Contain both aliphatic and aromatic parts
    - Example: Beta-carotene
